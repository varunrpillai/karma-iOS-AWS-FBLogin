# karma-iOS-AWS-FBLogin

######karma is a self initiated 3 day(2 day design+coding and 1 day testing + clean up + release) hackathon project. This project demonstrates my knowledge related to Objective-C coding and handling storyboard changes, Model-View-Controller, learning new technologies and integrating it with the project like Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Dynamo DB(NoSql DB) , Facebook login Service etc. Also, I had to write few lines of swift code for AWS support and made those methods called from objective-C . 


Karma app is indeed meant to be a simple app but it has some features which makes it unique and others existing apps does not provide. The purpose of this app are
** Track seven or less most important daily task that you feel it improves your life. This is not a todo app but for someone who practices yoga, it is those seven karmas that helps them achieve their ultimate goal.
** It is lack of motivation that restricts people from practicing their daily karma/tasks. Motivation to achieve this seven goals is through the garden that you build on the screen. To get the garden to have at itâ€™s best, the user has to accomplish all of his goals. This gamification of daily goals is one of the unique feature of the app. 
** This app saves the Karmas in cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Dynamo DB(NoSql DB).
** The app also provides a login using facebook.
** I have similar app in Android since 2015 - https://github.com/varunrpillai/karma
